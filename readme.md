* 0.1 work in progress

## How do I get set up? ##

* Clone this repo
* Download MongoDb, for reviewing, running and developing this API you need windows so select the appropriate Windows version 
[https://www.mongodb.org/downloads](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
* Install MongoDb, installing as a service is optional but saves you starting the service when you boot up 
[Install MongoDb as Windows Service](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/#run-the-mongodb-service)
* Download a mongodb client, [robomongo](http://robomongo.org/) is nice and free

* Open Forum.sln in Visual Studio (2012 or above)
* Build the solution
* Run Forum.Tools.Sample.exe to load some sample data to Mongo
* Set Forum.Api project as start project
* hit F5 to see API running
* OR set up the Api in IIS under the url localhost/forum-api (or whatever you want to configure it as)
